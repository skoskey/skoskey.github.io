# What's the deal here?
I've been thinking a bit recently, and I want to get better at "the craft of writing." So I figured I might as well start writing my thoughts â€“ and not in a stream-of-conscious way because nobody wants that mess. Hopefully this provides value to someone else. But if not, at least it'll serve me.

# A brief history of me
I'm Steven. I love coffee shops. I think that's because they combine sitting and daydreaming in a beautiful package. Right now I work as a data scientist and engineer at a small energy research consulting firm in Atlanta. We support electric power generation asset owners to model and maintain their equipment with a combination of physics-derived intuition and data-driven modeling.
