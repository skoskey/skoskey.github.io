# A brief history of me
I'm Steven. My two favorite things daydreaming and sitting â€“ naturally, I love coffee shops. Right now I work as a data scientist and engineer at a small energy research consulting firm in Atlanta, GA. We support electric power generation asset owners to model and maintain their equipment with a combination of physics-derived intuition and data-driven modeling.
